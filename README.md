# Spreadsheet Exercise

We’d like you to create a mini spreadsheet in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that looks and
works like Excel.
We have divided the task into 7 steps to help guide you in what we want you to build. We
recommend doing as much as possible in around 4 hours. Take longer if you want, but we
know this time can be hard to find so we don't expect you to. We will ask how much time
you spent in total.
We are looking to see: how you approach the problem, how you learned new things, how
you solved the problem (or set about to solve it), and as much working code as possible.

# Steps:
1. (done) Create index.html in your favourite text editor. Use pure JavaScript in your code – no
JavaScript libraries or frameworks. Your JavaScript can either be in a separate .js file, or it
can be contained in the index.html page.
2. (done) When loading index.html into Chrome or Firefox, it should draw a 100x100 grid of cells,
with columns labelled A-Z, AA, AB, AC, etc. and rows numbered 1 to 100.
3. (done) When you click in a cell and enter a number, it should store the number in a JavaScript
object (note: this would be lost when you refresh the page).
4. (done) Have a refresh button that redraws the grid (without refreshing the page) and inserts data
into cells where you've saved it.
5. Add support for some basic formulas. For example if you enter "=A1+A2" into A3 it
should calculate the sum of these two cells and display the result in A3. Updating A1 would
update A3.
6. Add support for some basic functions. For example if you enter "=sum(A1:A10)" into
A11, then it should calculate the sum of all cells in the range and display the result in
A11. Updating any value in the range would recalculate A11.
7. Add support for formatting, for example bold, italics and underline
Submitting your code
If you don’t finish all 7 steps, that's ok, but it would be helpful if you could share your plan
for building out the remaining steps. We're interested in your approach, what is important
to you, your planning, as well as seeing working code.
When you are done, send it through zipped via email, file share or link to your Git repo.
Thanks, and enjoy!
